# 📌 Project: Todo List
## 🔍 Overview
This Todo List project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Webpack integrated for optimized bundling and modular code management. I also created a separate gh-pages branch to deploy the live project on GitHub Pages.

Key libraries and tools used:

- **Webpack**: For efficient module bundling and project structure

- **date-fns:** To handle and format date-related tasks

- **Local Storage:** To persist data across browser sessions

✨ Features
- **CRUD Functionality**
Create, read, update (edit), and delete tasks with a simple and intuitive interface.

- **Project-Based Task Grouping**
Organize tasks by creating separate projects—helpful for managing multiple lists efficiently.

- **Task Priority Levels**
Tasks can be assigned priority levels, visually indicated by color:

🔴 Red – High priority (Very urgent)

🟡 Yellow – Medium priority (Moderate urgency)

🟢 Green – Low priority (Can be done later)

- **Responsive UI**
Designed with a clean and responsive layout to ensure a smooth experience across devices.

- **Persistent Storage**
Uses localStorage to retain tasks even after the browser is closed.

- **Modular Codebase with Webpack**
Clean and maintainable structure using Webpack’s module bundling.
